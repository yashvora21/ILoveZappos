# ILoveZappos

This project is meant to show demo of basic functionalities in Android Development. This Android application is developed in alignment with the Material Design guidelines of Android, is capable of handling basic configuration changes and uses the Retrofit, a type-safe HTTP Client to handle REST requests.

The application uses API provided by Zappos to handle REST requests and responses and display data in the app based on the respsonses received from this API. The application is developed using standard Development standards following MVC design pattern.

The application has 3 View Activities starting from the Query Activity where user enters the search query, following the page where the user cana see a List View of the products returned from the search query and finally the Product View page which displays basic information about the product along with a Floating Action Button to add or remove product from the cart using some animations.

I have used the following library to perform the animation task and would like to add credits to thhe library owner:
